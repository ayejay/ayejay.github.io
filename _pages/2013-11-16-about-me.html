<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>I am Ajay Sharma. I code for money and for fun also. If asked about the area of interests, I generally prefer to answer the P of "LAMP", design patterns, OOAD, TDD, unit testing. Due to nature of work I do, I also have some understanding of javascript and other alphabets of "LAMP".Â Apart from that, I also love to poke my head in things that get my attention every now and then. When I am not doing any of these, I would most probably be found placing small bets with my friends, reading wiki, having high decibel discussions or sleeping.</p>
